# Eigen::Utils

**EigenUtis** represents the effort of organizing a growing set of snippets into a coherent collection of algorithms that support the amzing Eigen Matrix lib ([Eigen Repository](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php))

**EigenUtils** makes it easier to create your algorithms, by eliminating a lot of the setup burden.

- You don't need to touch the command line
- You don't need to install/configure ruby, rvm/rbenv, ruby gems :relaxed:
- You don't need to install runtime dependencies like markdown processors, Pygments, etc
- It's easy to try out, you can just delete your forked repository if you don't like it

In a few minutes you'll be set up with a minimal, responsive header-only set of libs giving you more time to spend on writing code.

## Quick Start

### Step 1) Fork Jekyll Now to your User Repository

Fork this repo, then rename the repository to yourgithubusername.github.io.

Your Jekyll blog will often be viewable immediately at <https://yourgithubusername.github.io> (if it's not, you can often force it to build by completing step 2)

![Step 1](/images/step1.gif "Step 1")

### Step 2) Customize and view your site

Enter your site name, description, avatar and many other options by editing the _config.yml file. You can easily turn on Google Analytics tracking, Disqus commenting and social icons here too.

Making a change to _config.yml (or any file in your repository) will force GitHub Pages to rebuild your site with jekyll. Your rebuilt site will be viewable a few seconds later at <https://yourgithubusername.github.io> - if not, give it ten minutes as GitHub suggests and it'll appear soon

> There are 3 different ways that you can make changes to your blog's files:

> 1. Edit files within your new username.github.io repository in the browser at GitHub.com (shown below).
> 2. Use a third party GitHub content editor, like [Prose by Development Seed](http://prose.io). It's optimized for use with Jekyll making markdown editing, writing drafts, and uploading images really easy.
> 3. Clone down your repository and make updates locally, then push them to your GitHub repository.

### Step 3) Publish your first blog post

Edit `/_posts/2014-3-3-Hello-World.md` to publish your first blog post. This [Markdown Cheatsheet](http://www.jekyllnow.com/Markdown-Style-Guide/) might come in handy.

![First Post](/images/first-post.png "First Post")

> You can add additional posts in the browser on GitHub.com too! Just hit the + icon in `/_posts/` to create new content. Just make sure to include the [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) block at the top of each new blog post and make sure the post's filename is in this format: year-month-day-title.md

## Local Development

1. Install Jekyll and plug-ins in one fell swoop. `gem install github-pages` This mirrors the plug-ins used by GitHub Pages on your local machine including Jekyll, Sass, etc.
2. Clone down your fork `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourusername.github.io.git`
3. Serve the site and watch for markup/sass changes `jekyll serve`
4. View your website at http://127.0.0.1:4000/
5. Commit any changes and push everything to the master branch of your GitHub user repository. GitHub Pages will then rebuild and serve your website.

## Moar!

I've created a more detailed walkthrough, [**Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages**](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) over at the Smashing Magazine website. Check it out if you'd like a more detailed walkthrough and some background on Jekyll. :metal:

It covers:

- A more detailed walkthrough of setting up your Jekyll blog
- Common issues that you might encounter while using Jekyll
- Importing from Wordpress, using your own domain name, and blogging in your favorite editor
- Theming in Jekyll, with Liquid templating examples
- A quick look at Jekyll 2.0’s new features, including Sass/Coffeescript support and Collections

## Jekyll Now Features

## Contributing

Issues and Pull Requests are greatly appreciated. If you've never contributed to an open source project before I'm more than happy to walk you through how to create a pull request.

You can start by [opening an issue](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/issues/new) describing the problem that you're looking to resolve and we'll go from there.

I want to keep Jekyll Now as minimal as possible. Every line of code should be one that's useful to 90% of the people using it. Please bear that in mind when submitting feature requests. If it's not something that most people will use, it probably won't get merged. :guardsman:

# Eigen Iterators
Defines an iterator pointing to the first/last element in a Eigen::Array object

Since the Eigen::Array objects have no member functions begin/end defined nor have iterator member types, this snippet of code implements a random-access iterator of an unspecified type whose value_type is T and its reference type is T& for the mutable version and const T& for the constant iterator declaration.

This is an adaptation of begin/end helper functions defined for std::valarray, which in turn is an overload of std::begin/end, defined in <iterator>.

## Parameters:
x -> A Eigen::Array object.

## Demo
```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include "Eigen/Core"

#define NA 1000000.0

using namespace std;
using namespace Eigen;

int main() {
  ArrayXd side(side_par);
  side << 2.0, 2.0, NA, NA, 2.0;
  
  replace_if(begin(side), end(side), [](double i) { return (i == NA); }, 1.0);
  
  if( any_of(begin(side), end(side), [](double i) { return (fabs(i) != 1.0); }) ) {
    return 1;
  }
  return 0;
 }
 ```

# Eigen median, mean, variance
post-condition: After returning, the elements in v may be reordered and the resulting order is implementation defined.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1719070/what-is-the-right-approach-when-using-stl-container-for-median-calculation/1719155#1719155         
This algorithm handles both even and odd sized inputs efficiently using the STL nth_element (amortized O(N)) algorithm
and the max_element algorithm (O(n)). Note that nth_element has another guaranteed side effect, namely that all of the elements
before n are all guaranteed to be less than v[n], just not necessarily sorted.
